CONNECTION RESPONSE
CALL COMPLETED IS 10

--WHERE MINI_LOG_DATE between TODAY-8 and TODAY-1

NOT LIKE pattern

make sure that autodial_group has an active client number at start
make sure port class not this or that.

has tried it every day for at least 5 of the last 7 days and no success
I think we want this: where it has tried to report yesterday AND tried to report a week ago AND there has never been success.
